;remainder

;      x : integer

;Determines the remainder of dividing the first by the second integer

; modulo also finds the remainder of dividing the first integer by the second,
; but the (exact or inexact) part is not part of the definition.  They seem to 
; find the same result unless there are negative numbers involved, in which 
; case I'm not sure what's going on as they don't return what I would expect.

; NOTE: This had to be renamed to is-even because even was already implemented

; is-even? : Integer -> Boolean
; GIVEN: An integer
; RETURNS: Whether or not that number is even
; EXAMPLES:
; (is-even? 5) => false
; (is-even? 12) => true
; (is-even? -4) => true
; (is-even? -1) => false
; (is-even? 0) => true

(define (is-even? num)
  (= 0
     (remainder num 2)))
(is-even? 5)
(is-even? 12)
(is-even? -4)
(is-even? -1)
(is-even? 0)
