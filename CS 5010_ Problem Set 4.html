<h1>CS 5010: Problem Set 4</h1>

<p>
<strong>Out:</strong> Monday, February 10, 2014
</p>

<p>
<strong>Due:</strong> Monday, February 17, 2014 at 6:00pm local time
</p>

<p>
The goal of this problem set is to help you design functions using
higher-order functional composition with lists.
</p>


<p>In this problem set, you will redo the two questions from problem
set 3 using higher-order function composition (that is <kbd>map</kbd>, <kbd>foldr</kbd>,
<kbd>filter</kbd>, etc.) whenever possible.  This should be easy, so
to keep you on your toes, I've added a few new or changed
requirements. These are marked in <span class="new">red</span>.
</p>

<p>In fact, I believe that <em>every</em> structural decomposition on
lists in these problems can be replaced by a higher-order function
composition.</p>

<p>Hint: get your existing program going with HOFC everywhere before
starting on the new requirements.</p>

<p>Remember that you must follow the design recipe.
  Your <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs5010sp14/homework.html">deliverables</a> include the data
  analysis (including template), contract and purpose header,
  examples, design strategy, code, and tests. You must also include
  your laboratory notebook.</p>

<p>As you did before, download a copy of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs5010sp14/problem-sets/extras.rkt">extras.rkt</a> and put it in the folder with your solutions.
Download any other files that are needed for each problem.  Put
necessary <kbd>provide</kbd> and <kbd>require</kbd> directives at the
top of your file, as you did before. </p>

<h2>Required Exercises</h2>

<hr>

<ol>

  <li>Design a program called <kbd>inventory.rkt</kbd>, containing a set of
    functions for manipulating the inventory of a bookstore,
    represented as a list of books.  For each book, we must maintain
    the following information:<p></p>

  <ul>
    <li> isbn, an integer (the "international standard book number").
    This serves as a unique identifier for this book.</li>
    <li> title, a string</li>
    <li> author, a string </li>
    <li> publisher, a string</li>
    <li> unit price: a number, the price at which we will sell the book</li>
    <li> unit cost: a number, the cost of the book to the bookstore</li>
    <li> number of copies on hand</li>
    <li> re-order status.  Our bookstore periodically reorders books
    from the publisher.  For each book, there is at most one
    outstanding reorder.  If there is no reorder, the reorder status
    must represent this information. If there is a reorder, the
    re-order status contains the number of days until the the next
    shipment of this book is expected to arrive, and the number of
    copies expected to arrive at that time. Both of these are positive
    integers.</li>
    <li> the volume taken up by one unit of this item, in cubic
    feet.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The inventory satisfies the invariant that there are no
  duplicates:  any isbn appears at most once in the inventory.</p>

  <p>You also need to deal with orders.  An order is a list of line
  items.  A line item consists of a ISBN and the quantity
  ordered. The quantity ordered is a positive integer. Here
  is an example of an order; each line of the table is a line item.
  Here is an example of how an order might be displayed as a
  table.</p>

  <table>
  <tbody><tr><th>ISBN</th><th align="right">Quantity</th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>45861387</td>
    <td align="right">3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>19968208</td>
    <td align="right">15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>30581274</td>
    <td align="right">10</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody></table>

  <p>Like the inventory, an order will contain no duplicate line
  items: any isbn will occur at most once in an order.</p>

  <p>Also, for this problem, we introduce the Data Definitions
<kbd>MaybeInteger</kbd> and <kbd>MaybeNumber</kbd>:

</p><pre>;; A MaybeInteger is one of:
;; -- Integer
;; -- false

;; A MaybeNumber is one of:
;; -- Number
;; -- false
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>Design the following functions.</p>

  <p>All functions that return an inventory should return an inventory
  with the books in the same order they were in the argument. </p>

  <p>Your solution should provide the following functions:</p>

<pre>inventory-potential-profit : Inventory -&gt;  Number
GIVEN: an inventory
RETURNS: the total profit for all the items in stock (i.e., how much
the bookstore would profit if it sold every book in the inventory).

inventory-total-volume : Inventory -&gt; Number
RETURNS: the total volume needed to store all the books in stock.

price-for-line-item : Inventory LineItem -&gt; MaybeNumber
GIVEN: an inventory and a line item
RETURNS: the price for that line item (the quantity times the unit
price for that item).  Returns false if that isbn does not exist in
the inventory. 

fillable-now? : Order Inventory -&gt; Boolean.
GIVEN: an order and an inventory
RETURNS: true iff there are enough copies of each book on hand to fill
the order.  If the order contains a book that is not in the inventory,
then the order is not fillable.

days-til-fillable : Order Inventory -&gt; MaybeInteger
GIVEN: an order and an inventory
RETURNS: the number of days until the order is fillable, assuming all
the shipments come in on time.  Returns false if there won't be enough
copies of some book, even after the next shipment of that book comes
in.
EXAMPLES: if the order contains one book that is out of stock, with a
reorder status showing 2 days until delivery, then the order is
refillable in 2 days.  If the order is for 10 copies of the book, and
the next order consists of only 5 books, then should return false.

price-for-order : Inventory Order -&gt; Number
RETURNS: the total price for the given order.  The price does not
depend on whether any particular line item is in stock.  Line items
for an ISBN that is not in the inventory count as 0.

inventory-after-order : Inventory Order -&gt; Inventory.
GIVEN: an order
WHERE: the order is fillable now
RETURNS: the inventory after the order has been filled.

increase-prices : Inventory String Number -&gt; Inventory
GIVEN: an inventory, a publisher, and a percentage,
RETURNS: an inventory like the original, except that all items by that
publisher have their unit prices increased by the specified
percentage.
EXAMPLE: <kbd>(increase-prices inventory1 "MIT Press" 10)</kbd>
returns an inventory like the original, except that all MIT Press
books in the inventory have had their prices increased by 10%.

Also provide the functions:

make-book  (9 arguments)
make-line-item (2 arguments)
The arguments to these functions should appear in the same order as
they do in the problem statement.

reorder-present? : ReorderStatus -&gt; Boolean
RETURNS: true iff the given ReorderStatus shows a pending re-order.

make-empty-reorder : Any -&gt; ReorderStatus
Ignores its argument
RETURNS: a ReorderStatus showing no pending re-order. 

make-reorder : PosInt PosInt -&gt; ReorderStatus
GIVEN: a number of days and a number of copies
RETURNS: a ReorderStatus with the given data.
</pre>

<p>Rewrite these functions using map, foldr, filter, etc.</p>

<span class="new"><p>Every night, the bookstore puts on its shelves
the reorders that have come in from the publisher.  We assume that all
reorders arrive on time.  Thus, if we had a book with a reorder due in
one day, we assume those books have arrived and will be available for
sale the next morning.  The due dates for all other reorders should be
decremented to represent the fact that we are now one day closer to
having them arrive.  To keep track of all this, the bookstore uses a
function
</p><pre>update-inventory : Inventory -&gt; Inventory
GIVEN: today's inventory
RETURNS: an Inventory representing tomorrow's inventory, in which all
reorders that were due in 1 day are now available, and all other
reorders have their expected times decreased by 1.  
</pre>
Write and provide this function.  Use HOFC throughout.
<p></p></span>

<p> Before you turn in your solution, make sure it passes the tests
in <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs5010sp14/problem-sets/ps04-inventory-qualification.rkt"><kbd>ps04-inventory-qualification.rkt</kbd></a>. </p>

</li>

<li> (Balls in a Box).  Write a program called<kbd> balls-in-box.rkt</kbd> that
meets the following requirements:<p></p>

<ul>
  <li>Your program should display some
  balls, <span class="new">bouncing on a canvas,</span> that you can
  drag.</li>
  
  <li>The program starts with a canvas 400 pixels wide and 300 pixels
  high, with no balls.</li>
  
  <li>Hitting the "n" key should create a new ball in the center
  of the canvas<span class="new">, travelling right.</span>
  </li>

  <li><span class="new">Hitting the space key should pause or unpause
  the simulation.</span></li>
  
  <li><span class="new">The ball should bounce off the left and right
  sides of the canvas. Bouncing is defined as follows: if the ball
  would go past the left or right side, then it should appear tangent
  to the wall instead, travelling in the opposite direction.</span></li>
  
  <li>You can select a ball by doing a button-down inside the ball.
  When a ball is selected,
  <span class="new"> it stops moving and</span> you can drag it with
  the mouse.  It becomes unselected when you do a mouse-up.  The ball
  should be smoothly draggable, like the rectangle in problem set 2,
  and like the rectangle the ball cannot be dragged past the edges of
  the canvas.</li>

  <li>Hitting the "d" key when a ball is selected deletes the
  ball.</li>
  
  <li>The balls should be displayed as a circle with radius 20.  An
  unselected ball should be displayed as an outline; a selected ball
  should be displayed solid.  Unlike the draggable rectangle from
  problem set 2, you should NOT display the position of the mouse
  within the ball.</li>

  <li>In addition to the balls, you should display the number of balls
  currently on the canvas.</li> 

  <li>As before, you may assume the mouse is never dragged outside of
  the canvas.</li>

</ul>

<p>Your program should provide the following functions:</p>

<pre>run : <span class="new">PosInt PosReal</span> -&gt; World
GIVEN: <span class="new">a ball speed and a frame rate, in seconds per tick.</span>
EFFECT: runs the world.
RETURNS: the final state of the world.
EXAMPLE: <span class="new">(run 8 .25) creates and runs a world in which each
ball travels at 8 pixels per tick and each tick is 0.25 secs.</span> 

initial-world : <span class="new">PosInt</span> -&gt; World
GIVEN: a ball speed
RETURNS: a world with no balls<span class="new">, but with the property that any
balls created in that world will travel at the given speed.</span>

<span class="new">world-after-tick : World -&gt; World
RETURNS: the world that should follow the given world after a tick.</span>

world-after-key-event : World KeyEvent -&gt; World
RETURNS: the world that should follow the given world after the given
key event.

world-after-mouse-event : World Integer Integer MouseEvent -&gt; World
RETURNS: the world that should follow the given world after the given
mouse event.

world-balls : World -&gt; ListOf&lt;Ball&gt;
GIVEN: a world,
RETURNS: the list of balls that are in the box.

ball-x-pos : Ball -&gt; Integer
ball-y-pos : Ball -&gt; Integer
GIVEN: a ball
RETURNS: the x or y position of its center

ball-selected? : Ball -&gt; Boolean
GIVEN: a ball
RETURNS: true if and only if it is currently selected
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>Note: if any of these functions are implemented as selectors on
structs, then you don't need to provide the design recipe deliverables
for them.</p>

<p>If any function is just a renaming of a selector, for example
</p><pre>(define-struct ball (x y ...))
...
(define (ball-x-pos b)
  (ball-x b))
</pre>
then you need to deliver a contract and purpose statement, but you
don't need examples, strategy, or tests.
<p></p>

<p>As in the preceding question, you should solve this problem by
replacing every structural decomposition on a list by an appropriate
<kbd>map</kbd>, <kbd>foldr</kbd>, <kbd>filter</kbd>, etc.</p>

<p>Before you turn in your solution, make sure it passes the tests
  in <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs5010sp14/problem-sets/ps04-balls-in-box-qualification.rkt"><kbd>ps04-balls-in-box-qualification.rkt</kbd></a>.  As before,
  download this file, save it in your set04 directory, and run it to
  qualify your program for grading.  Be sure to commit this file to
  repository so we know that you've done this correctly.</p>
